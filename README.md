# Web Application Development Plan

For the following subject, I plan to develop a web application that allows users to enroll in, manage, and review various courses. Additionally, it will enable community interactions through discussions and resource sharing. The backend of the application will consist of:

- **User Authentication**: Implement secure login/logout functionality.
- **Course Management**: Functions for adding, updating, and listing courses.
- **Enrollment and Progress Tracking**: Manage course enrollments and monitor student progress.
- **Review System**: Allow users to post and view course reviews.
- **Community Interaction**: Facilitate course-related discussions and resource sharing.

This project provides a comprehensive platform for online learning, focusing on community engagement and interactivity. It allows learners to experience a dynamic educational system where they can learn, teach, and engage within a unified entity.
